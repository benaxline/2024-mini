## Exercise 1:
1. We observed that the "max_bright" is about 65000, and the "min_bright" is about 20000. 

## Exercise 2:
1. Create a song..."Stayin' Alive" Chorus.

We determined the different note frequencies based on sheet music that we found online. 

## Exercise 3:
In this exercise, we explored Firebase. We gathered data through the `exercise_game.py` script, editing and altering it to conform to the specifications. We first made the number of blinks to be 10 rather than 3. We also added numerous helper functions to connect to the wifi, send the data to the server, and look for wifi. 

For our REST API, we used Firebase. We connected to my hotspot and ran the Python script. For security reasons, we removed the wifi name and password.

After sending the data to the server, and Firebase receiving the data, it looks like this on the website.
